Magical Candy Bags 
You have N bags of candy. The ith bag contains arr[i] pieces of candy, and each of the bags is magical! 
It takes you 1 minute to eat all of the pieces of candy in a bag (irrespective of how many pieces of candy are inside), and as soon as you finish, the bag mysteriously refills. If there were x pieces of candy in the bag at the beginning of the minute, then after you've finished you'll find that floor(x/2) pieces are now inside. 
You have k minutes to eat as much candy as possible. How many pieces of candy can you eat? 
Signature 
int maxCandies(int[] arr, int K) 
Input 
1 ≤ N ≤ 10,000 
1 ≤ k ≤ 10,000 
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1,000,000,000 
Output 
A single integer, the maximum number of candies you can eat in k minutes. 
Example 1 
N = 5 
k = 3 
arr = [2, 1, 7, 4, 2] 
output = 14 
In the first minute you can eat 7 pieces of candy. That bag will refill with floor(7/2) = 3 pieces. 
In the second minute you can eat 4 pieces of candy from another bag. That bag will refill with floor(4/2) = 2 pieces. 
In the third minute you can eat the 3 pieces of candy that have appeared in the first bag that you ate. 
In total you can eat 7 + 4 + 3 = 14 pieces of candy.
