Given an array arr[] of non negative integers. We can perform a swap operation on any two adjacent elements in the array.
Find the minimum number of swaps needed to sort the array in ascending order.

Examples :

Input  : arr[] = {3, 2, 1}
Output : 3
We need to do following swaps
(3, 2), (3, 1) and (1, 2)

Input  : arr[] = {1, 20, 6, 4, 5}
Output : 5
)
There is an interesting solution to this problem. It can be solved using the fact that number of swaps needed is equal to number of
inversions. So we basically need to count inversions in array.

The fact can be established using below observations:
1) A sorted array has no inversions.
2) An adjacent swap can reduce one inversion. Doing x adjacent swaps can reduce x inversions in an array.

    Inversion Count for an array indicates â€“ how far (or close) the array is from being sorted. If array is already sorted then inversion count is 0. If array is sorted in reverse order that inversion count is the maximum.
Formally speaking, two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j

Example:
The sequence 2, 4, 1, 3, 5 has three inversions (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3).
